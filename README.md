ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction with Random Forest

A machine learning project that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using classification algorithmsâ€”primarily the Random Forest Classifier.


ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

The goal is to use machine learning to build a predictive model that can determine whether a Titanic passenger would survive based on historical data.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview :

Target Variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Features Used:

Pclass â€“ Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)

Sex â€“ Gender (0 = Female, 1 = Male)

Age â€“ Age in years

SibSp â€“ # of siblings/spouses aboard


ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing : 

Dropped irrelevant columns: PassengerId, Name, Ticket, Cabin
